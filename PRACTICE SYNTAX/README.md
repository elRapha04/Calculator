# Practice Syntax

This folder contains subfolders for each programming language I am learning. Each subfolder focuses on practicing the **basic syntax** of the language, which includes common programming constructs and operations. Below is a list of the fundamental topics to learn when exploring the syntax of a programming language:

## Basic Syntax Topics

1. **Displaying Output**
   (_Goal: Print information to the console_)

   - Print "Hello, World!"
   - Display a mathematical expression result (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8)
   - Print a formatted string with variables (e.g., "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old.")

2. **Receiving Input**
   (_Goal: Get user input and use it in the program_)

   - Ask for the user's name and greet them
   - Take two numbers as input and display their sum
   - Get a sentence from the user and print it in uppercase

3. **Variables and Data Types**
   (_Goal: Work with different data types_)

   - Declare and initialize an integer, float, string, and boolean
   - Swap the values of two variables
   - Convert a string into a number and perform a calculation

4. **Operators**
   (_Goal: Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators_)

   - Calculate the area of a circle given a radius
   - Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5
   - Compare two numbers and print whether they are equal, greater, or smaller

5. **Conditionals (if-else, switch-case)**
   (_Goal: Make decisions in code_)

   - Check if a user is old enough to vote (18+)
   - Convert numerical grades into letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)
   - Use a switch-case statement to print the day of the week based on a number (1-7)

6. **Loops (for, while, do-while)**
   (_Goal: Repeat tasks efficiently_)

   - Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop
   - Keep asking the user for a password until they enter the correct one
   - Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

7. **Functions**
   (_Goal: Create reusable code blocks_)

   - Create a function that returns the square of a number
   - Write a function that checks if a word is a palindrome
   - Make a function that calculates the factorial of a number

8. **Arrays and Lists**
   (_Goal: Store and manipulate collections of data_)

   - Store 5 numbers in an array and print them in reverse order
   - Find the largest number in an array
   - Remove duplicates from an array and print the result

9. **Objects (OOP Basics)**
   (_Goal: Work with objects and classes_)

   - Create a Car class with properties (brand, model, year) and display them
   - Make a Student class with a method to calculate the average grade
   - Implement an Employee class that includes a method to calculate salary after tax

10. **File Handling**
    (_Goal: Read from and write to files_)

    - Write a list of names to a text file
    - Read a text file and count the number of words in it
    - Append a new line of text to an existing file

11. **Error Handling (try-catch, exception handling)**
    (_Goal: Prevent program crashes due to errors_)

    - Handle division by zero gracefully
    - Catch an invalid user input (e.g., entering a letter when a number is expected)
    - Ensure a file exists before trying to open it

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific programming language, and contains the following:

- **Basics**: Code examples and exercises focused on the language’s basic syntax.
- **Projects**: Simple projects or mini-programs to apply what you’ve learned from the basics.
